# README Generator

## Description

The README Generator is a Node.js commandline application that automates the process of creating a README for a new project. The application uses the inquirer package for the question prompts.

By answering prompts in the command line, users can quickly generate a README that covers title, description, installation, usage, license, contribution guidelines, tests and questions.

This application helps developers spend less time creating documentation, leaving more time to focus on their application.
